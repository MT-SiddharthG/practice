"""
1.1 A click counter is a small hand-held device that contains a push button and
a count display. To increment the counter, the button is pushed and the new
count shows in the display. Clicker counters also contain a button that can be
pressed to reset the counter to zero. Design and implement the Counter ADT
that functions as a hand-held clicker.
